# Proxmox-PVE-scripts
The scripts I use for automating the creation of Virtual Machines on Proxmox PVE

This is my repo for storing the scripts to create my virtual machines on Proxmox PVE. Dont't expect anything fancy, I'm quite a noob when it comes to scripting.
Besides being a noob in scripting, I'm also quite lazy and I want to be able to setup my Server in more easy and recreatable way. I had to swap out my old ssd's in my for some better quality ones because they were wearing out more quickly than I like. This is a good chance do setup things in a better way. I used to create virtual machines by hand, install them manualy, and configure the service(s) I had in mind for the server. I like using docker, and the infrastructure as code approach of the compose files inspires me now to make creation scripts for VM's on Proxmox PVE. Possibly I'm going to use ansible or some kind of alternative for some more automation tasks.

My server is always a work in progress. I use it just for the learning experience, and besides that for running some nice servers to make my life easier. Having the learning experience as priority I do breake things some times. My goal is to keep a up a little with the technlologies that are running our companies and society. 

I'm in no way an IT professional, so chances are I make stupid design choices or compromises a sane person won't make. And while staying open for suggestions, I might not respond to communication or update this repo regelarly. 

Use on your own risk ;)
