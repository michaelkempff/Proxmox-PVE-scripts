# Proxmox-PVE-scripts
The scripts I use for automating the creation of Virtual Machines on Proxmox PVE

This is my repo for storing the scripts to create my virtual machines on Proxmox PVE. Dont't expect anything fancy, because I'm quite a noob when it comes to scripting.
Besides being a noob in scripting, I'm also quite lazy and I want to be able to setup my Server in more easy and recreatable way. I had to swap out the old ssd's in my server for better quality ones because they were wearing out more quickly than I like. This is a good chance do setup things in a better way.

I'm in no way an IT professional, so chances are I make stupid design choices or compromises a sane person won't make. So while staying open for sugestions, I might not respond or update this repo regelarly. 

Use on your own risk ;)
