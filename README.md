# Proxmox-PVE-scripts
This is my repo for storing the scripts i use to (re)create my virtual machines on Proxmox PVE. Dont't expect anything fancy, I'm a noob when it comes to scripting.

Besides being a noob in scripting, I'm also quite lazy and I want to be able to setup my digital infrastructure in a more easy and recreatable way. I had to swap out the old ssd's in my server for some better quality ones because they where wearing out more quickly than I like. 

This is a good chance to setup things in a better way. I used to create virtual machines by hand, install them manualy, and configure the service(s) I had in mind for the server. 

I like using docker, and the infrastructure as code approach of docker compose files inspires me to make scripts for creating my VM infrastructure on Proxmox PVE. Possibly I'm going to use ansible or some kind of alternative for some more automation tasks.

My server is always a work in progress. I just use it for the learning experience, and besides that for running some nice applications to improve my digital experience. Having learning as my priority I do breake things some times. My main goal is to keep a up a little with the technologies that are running our society and companies. 

I'm by no means an IT professional, so big chances are I make stupid design choices or compromises a sane person won't make. And while staying open for suggestions, I might not respond to communication or update this repo regularly. 

Use at your own risk ;)
